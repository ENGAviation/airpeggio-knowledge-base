# Viewing and Editing Flight Logs

This tutorial will cover how to view and edit flight logs. This feature is best used after a trip has been flown to either verify the accuracy or adjust possible crew mistakes.

## Access flight logs

Navigate to [Airpeggio.io](https://airpegg.io/) and login. 

Select 'Reservations' from the top ribbon and select a trip by clicking the eye icon.

Scroll down to the 'Flight Logs' section and click the pencil icon to edit. You'll see 3 sections on the following form, 'Edit Flight Log', 'Squawks', and 'Notes'. You can make tach/hobbs adjustments, add fuel uplift, add squawks, and other trip notes. Make the necessary adjustments and click the 'Update Flight Log' button. Do this as necessary for all trip legs.
