# Create Crew Member Profiles

This tutorial will cover how to create crew member profiles. You can create different user types with granular user permissions. Let's get started.


## Add Crew Member Account

Navigate to [Airpeggio.io](https://airpegg.io/) and login. 

Select 'Accounts' and click the 'Add Account' button.

On the next screen you'll see standard fields for name and email. Next, you'll select Pilot and/or Scheduler user types. Pilots permissions are limited to view only, however Airpeggio offers granular permissions for the Scheduler user persona. You can select from a recommended set of permissions based on role (Admin/Manager/Sales/Chief Pilot) or grant a blend of RWD (Read/Write/Delete) permissions per area of Airpeggio functionality.

Once finished, click 'Add Account'. The new user will then receive a welcome email for steps on how to access their newly created account.
