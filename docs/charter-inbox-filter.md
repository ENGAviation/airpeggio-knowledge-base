# Setup Charter Inbox and Filters

This tutorial will cover how to create your Airpeggio charter inbox and a filter. This can be used to filter your flight requests based on certain preferences such as airport code, nautical mile range, passenger limits, and other criteria. First, let's connect your Airpeggio to your email client.


## Connect your Email

Navigate to [Airpeggio.io](https://airpegg.io/) and login. 

Select 'Inbox' from the top ribbon, then click on the 'Connect Email' button.

You'll see your email forwarding details displayed in the popup. Simply copy the string in the grey box and add that as a forwarding rule from whatever source you use to accept trip requests. Many customers use some sort of shared mailbox, but the Airpeggio configuration team is happy to assist if your environment is unique. For common examples, follow the links to Gmail, Outlook, and M365 examples.
